**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In the first week I have very limited understanding on which different methods/frameworks are suitable in an agile project.
In the lectures I have heard about Scrum but I am not sure exactly how this concrete will be implemented.
My goal is to learn about Scrum by learning about some concrete examples of what different elements such as a product backlog or user story might look like. 
I want to reach my goal by experimenting with a Trello to customize a board this sprint and add cards that represent items in a real agile project. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I believe that because we as a team have limited experience with using tools such as Trellos one goal could be to help with how Trello can be implemented in our agile project.
To do this it will require me to learn more about the Trello tool and create test boards where we can try different approaches to find out what works best for all of us.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
In this first week my knowledge about scrum is very limited and therefore it's hard to contribute to the team's application of scrum.
I want to help the team's application of scrum by fixing a Trello so we easier view our product and sprint backlogs. 
To do this I can search the web for current best practices of combining Trello with Scrum and adapt to our current project format. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
For this first week it's hard to determine exactly our team's deliveries.
I believe this goal will be more to find out about which deliveries our team will and should have.
To get there I will be part of our group meetings and lectures.
