## Individuell reflection

**v3**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous long sprint has been full of learnings. We are almost up and running with our development environment. At the moment I need to successfully be
able to start the app from Android Studio now that we have the correct files from avajadi. I want to learn more about React in order to start delivering on
the user stories we are developing.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For our coming meetings it is suggested I join as an area "expert" due to my knowledge of the maritime sector and the lingo they use. This way I can quickly
minimize the barrier that is introduced by this being a fairly unknown area to most students.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have implemented into our meeting structure what I hope will help us move forward toward our goal each meeting. The sprint goals are now transferred
by me into each meeting document to ensure we are making progress towards those goals.
Monday meetings have been structured to walk us through the process of sprint review/retrospective, sprint planning and daily scrum (we end and start sprint
on mondays as of now)

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
At the moment this has been taking notes during our first meeting with the Pilot Organization. Also making sure that we exit this meeting with the info we need
to build our user stories. Also further improving on our meeting structure.
In the future I will instead be free to actively ask questions during meetings due to my area expertise. Other than that I have brought input to suggesting
fixes to get everyone up and running in the development environment, which I got to work in the previous iteration.


**v2.1**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous week my main goal was to understand the tools better, like Git and Github. Hopefully I will successfully be able to upload this reflection, along with our team reflection without any major hitches.
Our working processes have been slightly refined but much remains to be done. A successful implementation of the Scrum workflow is the next thing I want to learn how to achieve.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have tried to make our meeting structure easy to influence and access so that we can look both at what we have done and what is upcoming for the team.
Due to my previous experience in the maritime sector working with communications on commercial vessels I have extensive experience and knowledge within that area, some of which may be useful to this project.
I do notice however that this experience also gives me major "tunnel vision" when it comes to what I think needs to be addressed during our meetings and I will work on decoupling this "communications perspective" in order to synthesize efficient tidbits of information that are genuinely helpful to the group.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The meeting workflow (that I am responsible for) is slowly adapting to something that is more closely integrated to the Now, Goal, Gap evaluation process.
My goal is that by highlighting our goals on each meeting, we get reinforcement to our p = mv forward.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we broke down the timeline of a vessel on approach to Gothenburg, and my contribution consisted of the knowledge I have of this from my previous work.
Insights such as constantly changing ETA:S, ETD:S and ETB:S could provide valuable contributions to our future work.

**v1**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
Starting out the first week I have been introduced to both GitHub and Scrum, tools/frameworks that I have never worked with before, and have no knowledge of.
My goal is to master these tools and that usage of them shall be second nature.
For these first weeks I will attend the exercises held during lectures, and also practice through setting up our project on GitHub to become more knowledgeable on the subject.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week we started out with little knowledge of Scrum/Github. Through the exercise provided we all had some initial practice in working on sprints.
My goal for the team is that we quickly find ourselves in a productive routine through which we can provide value for our stakeholders in the coming weeks.
By highlighting our knowledge gaps, asking all the questions I can come up with, I hope to advance us quickly through the learning curve.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We started out with no experience in the application of Scrum this week.
My goal is to be an active contributor, and to have tried on multiple roles throughout this course.
For this weeks exercise, I took on the role of scrummaster, noting the difficulties of information sharing across groups.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week our deliveries consisted in LEGO structures of different kinds.
My goal for my contributions is to deliver and that I can bring value through each contribution.
For this weeks exercise I had practice in managing the product owners expectations, and negotiating what is a reasonable delivery with the time constraints we were working under, delivering a smaller part of the User Story that was most important.
